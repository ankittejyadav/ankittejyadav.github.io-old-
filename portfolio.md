## 🌟 Architectural Vision & System Design

The system is architected as a lightweight, Client-Side Rendered (CSR) Single Page Application (SPA). The primary design goal was to maximize performance, responsiveness, and maintainability while eliminating the operational overhead of a traditional server-backed application. By deploying the compiled static assets to a globally distributed Edge CDN, the architecture guarantees high availability, zero-cold-start latency, and near-instantaneous global delivery.

### Core Data & System Flow
*   **Ingestion / Input**: User interaction events (navigation, filtering, modal triggers) serve as the primary inputs. These events are captured by React's synthetic event system and processed via declarative state handlers.
*   **Processing / Logic**: Business logic is executed entirely within the client-side runtime. The application utilizes functional components and React hooks to manage UI state transitions, ensuring that component re-renders are localized and performant.
*   **Persistence & Caching**: Static assets, including optimized images and compiled JavaScript bundles, are cached aggressively at the CDN edge. Client-
